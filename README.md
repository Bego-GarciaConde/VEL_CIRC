# VEL_CIRC
By multiprocessing methods we calculate the accelerations of the different components of the simulation onto a mesh grid situated at the plane Z=0.
Calculate circular velocity by calculating the radial (centripetal) forces in a mesh situated at the galactic plane. This calculation is an approximation of the Vcirc for stars following orbits in the galactic plane.
